Image Pyramid tools for Mathematica

These are tools that are old enough to vote, but still might be useful to someone. If you look carefully, there are notes from CVS checkins. They were probably in SCCS before that. 

Presently, they rely on old Mathematica v. 4 Statistics packages and some internal stuff of mine.
